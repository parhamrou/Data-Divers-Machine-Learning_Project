# Data-Divers-Machine-Learning_Project
In this project, for the first part, we had gather data and join that with the main data source which was a excel file, and make a dashboard on data expectency data. 
After that, for the second part, we had to use a machine learning model and train our data to predict life expetency based on some given data. 
### Dashboard
For seeing dashboard, you have to navigate to streamlit folder, and run:

`streamlit run intro.py`
### Model
Our model is in model.ipynb file. you can see that we used polynomial regression to predict life expectency.
